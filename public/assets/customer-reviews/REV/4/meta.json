Finally when i decided to try it out and went to the shop, Ayisha and her team welcomed us though we were late for the appointment.She and her stylist stayed all the while until 9pm+ to fit the hair piece.I wanted to write this review few months are trying the product. Itâ€™s been more than 3 months so I can very confidently say that their product is very genuine and really really good.My old friends whom i haven't seen for many years couldn't find any difference and all of my relatives and family gave a Big thumbs up for my new look !! Some couldn't even find that I am using hair piece so they asked me if I grew my hair naturally (ha ha).I am truly happy and I would strongly recommend this product to others. Once again I want to thank Ayisha and her team for their excellent service in this industry. I sincerely pray that they will be blessed and will multiply !!
