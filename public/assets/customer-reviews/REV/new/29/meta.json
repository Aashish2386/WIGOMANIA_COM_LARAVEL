I have scanty hair and was looking for solutions that don't require me to take   any medications or surgery.   I took 4 hours to choose and get convinced that I was in the right place.   Ayesha is the one you need to talk to. ..   She is extremely knowledgeable, personable and forthcoming with all the   information needed.   She made me feel comfortable and helped me over come my inhibitions at   ease.   I left wigomania looking 10 years younger.  ","revreply":"  Hi Preethi.
