With lot of questions in mind.....   What will i do.   And then suddenly i started thinking of people who had lost their limbs and   were still surviving happily.   It suddenly struck that i should try a wig and here was my sister in law daksha   bhabhi who knew something about wig-o-mania.   She immediately offered to take me.   And we reached the hair shoppee.   The shoppee had a great ambience and i should mention about your manager   ayesha who very gracefylly took me through the process.   Time and again she solved all my queries.   When ever i needed her she was there to solve my problem.   I still remember time and agin she was requesting me to try the wig, so that   ones i am in mumbai i will not face problem.   I am happy and i am enjoying it thorouhly, it has made me more confident.   Thanks to all the lovely staffs of wig o mania especially ayesha what an   excellent human being.   Thanks ones again.   Though i found the wig a little costly, i am happy.   With that happy note i would say love you dear, thank you.
