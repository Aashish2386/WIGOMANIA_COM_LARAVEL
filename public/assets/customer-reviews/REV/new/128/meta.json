I came across wigomania and seeing the reviews i contacted Ayesha. She is one of the sweetest persons, i have come across in my life. I just mentioned during our first meet, that i needed privacy, she remembers and makes sure i get the needed privacy everytime i got to store. She knows a lot, really a lot about hair and really a lot about how i feel. I was trying to explain what i wanted and she correctly identified my need and helped with the right hair piece. You can just blindly go by her words. She understands you.She gives you her time, her advice and even follows up after u get the product. She is a truly a blessing in disguise for people like me. She attends everyone personally. I once tried to wash and accidentally tangled the product, she was so courteous enough to take , detangle and gave me a spare one. Shes so down-to-earth and the products they have too are varied. More than the store, its the people and the service they offer make your day. Ayesha is a such a good soul. If it werenot for her, i cant imagine my plight. She is such a cutie pie and i like her to bits, I have already purchased 2 products from her and would love to go back. Thanks and big hugs to you. Thanks very much Nishi. You are such a doll. God bless you Ayesha and all. Thanks. -K","revreply":"Thank you so much for your glowing appreciation and acknowledgment of our products and managers.
