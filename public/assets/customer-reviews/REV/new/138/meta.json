Have tried many wig shops and wasted a lot of money ..none was worth it. I suffered a lot in handling it .... I tried wigomania for the first time I am loving my self with my new look ..ayesha mam and all the co-workers are a sweety pie\\'s\ud83d\ude0d ...she hears all your requiremets so patiently and fulfills it ..They clearly guide in the right path...the guidance I saw here I have not seen in any wig shops... I promise you will never regret for coming to wigomania \ud83d\ude00.... felt myself new with full of confidence only because of wigomania...do visit here if u are in the idea of buying wigs .. THEY ARE THE BEST AND BETTER CHOICE..I mean it from bottom of my heart \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d","revreply":"Wig-O-Mania continues to make a difference in people\\'s lives\r\nAn appreciation like this makes us more determined to continue to serve and bring a smile\r\nThanks Darshana.
