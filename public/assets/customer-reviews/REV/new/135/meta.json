I used to travel abroad to get my hair extension done. Since this pandemic I couldn\\'t travel so I\\'ve tried many places in Chennai which I would not like to mention their names where they disappointed me with their hair extensions. All the places I\\'ve tried in Chennai mentioned that there were no good quality hair extension available in Chennai except in abroad. Fortunately one day I found out about Wigomania hair studio on instagram and I decided to visit their place without any confidence. There i met Aysha and she gave me such good hospitality and she was very patience to answer all my enquiries. After speaking to her I decided to try out the hair extension and I got surprised to see my hair looked very natural and the layer cut which I got was something that I always wanted for a long time. I didn\\'t expect the hair extension would be excellent in quality. Special thanks to Zoni the stylist who did an amazing job. I felt like I got my hair extension done in abroad. Thanks to Wigomania once again, for launching this hair studio in Chennai making it easy for all the men and women out there to get amazing hair done in our homeland itself.","revreply":"Hi Priya.\r\nWe feel truly humbled having received such a glowing appreciation.\r\nWe certainly strive to make a difference in people\\'s life with our exclusive range of products, our services and most important our empathy towards our client\\'s situations and their requirements.\r\n\r\nHowever it is always a wonderful feeling and a great morale boaster for our entire team at every levels to be so highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nWe thank you for your patronage and certainly look forward to serving you in the near future.\r\n#staysafe #stayblessed #stayhealthy\r\n \r\n"}
