On the first day of my visit, i did not had a clear idea of which Patch to buy so i just tried the Patch. I revisited the store with my daughter and then i purchased a Pacth. Though Rosy thought me on how to keep and blend the Patch, i was not sure and confident on keeping the wig by myself.so again I visited the store 3rd time,and got the consultation on blending and using the Patch properly.During all my 3 visits,I have observed very clearly that staff did not hesitate to warmly welcome and treat us well. Out of all these things,I must seriously appreciate a person and that is ROSY.No matter how many times I asked her about the Patch and blending,She helped me in finding the right Patch and showed me all varied wig blending techniques.I heartily thank her for her constant cheerful service and her patience,dedication and she has that heart and zeal of helping people.she is the one who will understand the need of the customer and come up with the best solution.Very great job dear Rosy.she can turn any pathetic situation into something beautiful.she brought that smile back. Wig o mania has wide variety of products to choose from. I am very much satisfied with the product. Thank you once again for your efforts in making people happy.","revreply":"Thanks so much for your kind words and appreciation.
