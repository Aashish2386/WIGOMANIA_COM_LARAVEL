Finally satisfied.\r\n\r\n","revreply":"Thank you so much for your comments and appreciation. \r\nWe are thrilled to note that we have helped you make the correct choice. \r\nOur staff are well trained to ensure each client is offered the best service, correct advice and products. \r\nHospitality is the key to appreciating and valuing our patrons.\r\nPlease do visit us again if you need any further advice or support.
