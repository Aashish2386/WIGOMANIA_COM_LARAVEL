Having read about them here in google, i decided to give it a shot and happy   that i did.   Ayesha is patient and explains well and recommendeds the right solutions for   the indivual customer.   The product is of high quality and they try to match the product as per   customer wish.   I wanted slight changes to the product after sale and even their after sale   service was on par, i ended buying a second product :) .   They have a vairtey of solutions and i would recommend this for users of both   types, whether necessity or fashion !.   Thank you team for making my daily life easier..
