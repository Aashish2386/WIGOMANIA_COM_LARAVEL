As I am looking for a glue paste model wig in wig o mania?  ","revreply":"  Dear Mr Kumar, Kindly read the reviews and you should get your answers.   However keep in mind it all depends on the way it is used, how much you   sweat and the reaction of the sweat on your scalp, how long are you in the   sun, heat and also mainly how you react to the occasional itch that you may   get because of your sweat (nothing to do with our product).   If you are going to be in sun long hours, resulting in sweating then we suggest   you opt for MonoBase clip which certainly is longer lasting, more durable and   does not need servicing as regularly as a glue paste toupee.   This is our professional advise, suggestion and recommendation.  "}
